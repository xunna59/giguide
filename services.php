                               <h5>What is a business operating system?</h5>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">A business operating system (BOS) is a set of processes and tools that help an organization manage its businesses.. It includes everything from financial management to human resources to customer relationship management. A BOS can be either manual or automated.<p></p> A manual BOS requires more effort to maintain, but it can be customized to fit the specific needs of your business. An automated BOS is more expensive, but it can save time and resources in the long run. <p></p> The decision of which type of BOS to use depends on the size and complexity of your business, as well as its budget. A small business might not need all the features of a large enterprise-level BOS, so a manual system might be sufficient. Conversely, a large business might find an automated system more efficient and easier to use</p>

<h5>How to re-brand a business operating system</h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
   A business operating system (BOS) is the engine that helps a company manage its day-to-day operations. It can be a complex system that works in collaboration with a company’s business model, and it’s important to design the right system for your business. 
</p>
   <p style="text-align: justify;">
      If you’re not happy with your current BOS, or if you want to update your brand, you may be considering a re-brand. This can be a big undertaking, but it can also be very rewarding. Here are some tips for how to successfully re-brand your business operating system:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do your research. Before you make any changes, it’s important to do your research and understand your options. What are other companies using? What do they like or dislike about their BOS? What would be the best fit for your company? Answering these questions will help you make the best decision for your business.</li>
  <li>Make a plan. Once you’ve decided to rebrand, it’s important to make a plan. This should include what changes you want to make, how you will implement them, and what timeline you’re working with. Trying to do too much at once can be overwhelming, so it’s important to focus on one thing at a time and have a clear plan for how you will execute each change.</li>
  <li>Communicate with your team. Your team is going to be a key part of this process.</li>
</ul>

                              <h5>Defining IT solutions</h5>


                              <p style="text-align: justify;">

                                 Information technology solutions (IT solutions) are a set of tools, processes, and services used to create, store, exchange, and use information. They can be used in a variety of ways to support business objectives such as creating new products and services, improving customer service, or reducing costs.

                              </p>



                              <p style="text-align: justify;">

                                 The term IT solution is often used interchangeably with information technology (IT) product. However, an IT solution typically includes not only the software or hardware product itself, but also the associated services required to implement and support the product.

                              </p>



                              <p style="text-align: justify;">

                                 An effective IT solution must align with the specific needs of the business it is intended to support. It should also be easy to use and maintain, so that employees can quickly adopt it and realize its full potential benefits.

                              </p>

<h5>Brand counselling case studies</h5>

 <p style="text-align: justify;">

There are many different ways to approach brand counselling, and no one right way. Here are three case studies of how we've helped clients navigate their brands.

</p>

<h6>Case Study 1: Naming a new business</h6>

 <p style="text-align: justify;">

We were approached by a client who was starting a new business. They had a general idea of the services they wanted to offer, but were stuck on what to name the business. After some discussion, we helped them narrow down their options and eventually settle on a name that fit their brand identity.
 </p>


<h6>Case Study 2: Rebranding an existing business</h6>

 <p style="text-align: justify;">

We were approached by a client who had an existing business, but felt that their brand no longer accurately represented their company. After some exploration and soul-searching, we helped them come up with a new name, logo, and overall look that better matched their current identity
 </p>

 <h6>Case Study 3: Developing an entirely new brand</h6>


 <p style="text-align: justify;">
We were approached by a client who didn't have an existing business, but knew they wanted to start one in the near future. We worked with them from the very beginning to help develop their brand identity, including names, logos, colors, etc. This was probably the most involved process of the three cases studies, but it resulted in a strong foundation for the client's future business.

</p>

<h5>What Is PPC?</h5>


 <p style="text-align: justify;">
So, what is PPC? PPC stands for ‘pay per click’, a type of online advertising that sees advertisers pay every time someone clicks on their ads. This sets PPC advertising apart from more traditional methods, such as print or billboard ads, where advertising space is rented on a fixed price basis, regardless of whether anybody interacts with the ad or not. <br><br>

PPC also has the advantage of being extremely measurable. Our PPC experts can see exactly what is driving positive results to double down on these tactics, while eliminating areas that aren’t performing as well. We’ve got your back. <br><br>

<p style="text-align: justify;">

Paid Social media advertising is a form of digital advertising that delivers specific pieces of content to a target audience, using demographics, interests, connections and other factors to determine who are the most relevant targets.

<p style="text-align: justify;">

<h5>How does Paid Social media advertising work?</h5>


<p style="text-align: justify;">

Social media paid advertising works by creating an ad on your chosen social media platform that targets those who will be most interested in your offering. 

<br><br>
You decide what the content should be, what actions consumers should take, how long the ad should be live for and what the budget is. This will determine how many people see your paid ad over its lifetime, as your budget is used whenever a click is made. 

<br><br>

Simply, when someone clicks on your Paid Social ads, you pay the piper. The actual cost depends on the type of advert and the targeting. The lower the cost per click, the higher the profit. Optimising paid for ads keeps you in the game for longer and G I Guide does this.
